I am a PhD student in the Machine Learning Program at [Georgia Tech] (https://ml.gatech.edu/). My research is at the intersection of machine learning and materials science, centered on developing sustainable energy solutions. Currently I am applying machine learning and physics-based modeling to study renewable energy materials. My experience is in spatial data analysis, molecular representation learning and materials informatics. This research is generously supported by the [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program]. (https://www.nsfgrfp.org/)

Previously, I earned a bachelor’s degree in Chemical Engineering from Stanford University and a Master’s degree in Computer Science from Georgia Tech. I also have industry experience at Shell Martinez Refining as a hydrotreating process engineer and at The Home Depot as a data scientist.

Outside of research, I am passionate about advocating for underrepresented minorities in STEM fields, raising awareness to student mental health and wellbeing, and teaching Math and Science to K-12 students.
