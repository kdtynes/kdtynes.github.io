abstract = {Automatically recommending visually compatible products to Home Decor shoppers is a challenging task for ecommerce companies in the home improvement domain. However, few satisfactory solutions have been proposed to address this problem. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that uses a room scene image as the primary data source to generate visually compatible product recommendations. More specifically, we first detect products shown in the room scene image. Then, we use image retrieval techniques (e.g. color matching and triplet contrastive learning) to find the most similar products, if not the same, from the catalog. The system is designed to scale up to millions of products. To evaluate the performance of the proposed approach under various scenarios and use cases, we test it on several decor datasets, e.g. the catalog of a large home improvement retailer, a sizable public decor dataset, and customer-generated images posted on product reviews. We compare the approaches and determine that the triplet contrastive learning outperforms color matching for image retrieval. When tested live on the retailer's website, this new experience increases by 1.5% the user engagement and by 4.0% the Average Order Value (AOV) of transactions.},
